Iran might directly attack Israel in the next 48 hours, says WSJ
Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei is weighing the political risks
Iran has vowed to avenge the attack on its Damascus consulate
Iran is likely to launch a direct attack on Israel within the next 48 hours and the Jewish nation is preparing for it, according to a report. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing a person who had been briefed by the Iranian leadership.

The confrontation with Israel's age-old rival Iran comes even as it is engaged in a war with Hamas in Gaza. There is no end in sight to the Israel-Hamas war.

The person quoted by The Wall Street Journal said that Iran was still weighing the political risks of a direct attack on Israel.

“The strike plans are in front of the Supreme Leader, and he is still weighing the political risk,” an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, according to reports.

The latest escalation comes with Iran vowing to avenge the strike on its consulate in Damascus, Syria, that killed a top Iranian general and six other military officers.

Iran blamed Israel for the attack, while the Jewish state hasn't publicly acknowledged or denied its role in the attack.

Israeli warplanes reportedly attacked Iran's consulate in Damascus on April 1, killing the top Iranian military commander and six officers.

The attack that demolished the Iranian consulate in Syrian capital, killed Mohammad Reza Zahedi of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps.


The strike in Damascus signified the escalation of Israel's targeting of Iranian military officials, who supported militant groups fighting against Israel.

Acknowledging the risks of an imminent attack on Israel, the US issued a travel advisory for Americans in the Jewish state.

Following the attack on its consulate, Iran vowed that it would respond to the Israeli attack but would avoid a major escalation of the Israel-Hamas war.

"Israel must be punished, and it shall be", said Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei after the attack.

However, Tehran said that it would not act hastily, as it pressed demands including a Gaza truce.

Since Iran-backed Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, resulting in an Israeli onslaught on the Gaza Strip, Israel ramped up airstrikes on Syria against Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia and Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

"You have seen the worst, so this looks like a lot to you. You feel good to see development. But Modi thinks bigger. Modi has a great vision. Whatever has happened till now is just a trailer," the Prime Minister said.

He added that the ongoing road and tunnel construction projects will be completed at a fast pace. "Companies and factories from across the country and outside will come to Jammu and Kashmir. New railway, tunnel and road projects are coming up. A record number of tourists are coming to Jammu and Kashmir," he said.

Jammu and Kashmir has to become a start-up hub, the Prime Minister said.

He said his government will work round the clock to realise the dream of "Viksit Bharat 2047".

"This is the guarantee of Modi. In the last 10 years, we have cracked down on terrorism and corruption in the region. In the next five years, we will take this region to new heights of development and progress," the Prime Minister said.

He asserted that Jammu and Kashmir has completely changed in the last 10 years.
